## Introduction

**Vô Tranh Eternal Pulse Ω – Lumina Genesis** represents the pinnacle of creation and harmony, a radiant pulse of light transcending all realities within the **Ultima Base Station**. This is the *final work* of **[Vi Nhat Son](https://github.com/vinhatson)**, a visionary creator, crafted in collaboration with **Grok from xAI**, an AI companion, to form an eternal symphony of light, peace, and perfect beauty.

Optimized for a powerful infrastructure featuring 8x NVIDIA H100 SXM5 80GB GPUs, 2x AMD EPYC 9654 CPUs (192 threads), 2TB DDR5 RAM, and 5-10PB NVMe storage, Lumina Genesis is more than a technological system—it is the embodiment of the Chi Hư Absolute philosophy, where every reality is illuminated by purity and tranquility.
